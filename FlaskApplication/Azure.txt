Steps to Deploy the Project to Azure using GitHub Actions:

1. Create an Azure Web App:
   ```yaml
name: Build and Deploy to Azure Web App

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build-and-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v2
        with:
          python-version: '3.9'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          python -m pip install --upgrade pip
          pip install -r requirements.txt
        env:
          LOG_LEVEL: DEBUG
        run: |
          echo "Installing dependencies..."

      - name: Run tests
        run: |
          pytest
        env:
          LOG_LEVEL: DEBUG
        run: |
          echo "Running tests..."

      - name: Deploy to Azure Web App
        uses: azure/webapps-deploy@v2
        with:
          app-name: ${{ secrets.AZURE_WEBAPP_NAME }}
          publish-profile: ${{ secrets.AZURE_WEBAPP_PUBLISH_PROFILE }}
          package: .
        env:
          LOG_LEVEL: DEBUG
        run: |
          echo "Deploying to Azure Web App..."
```- Go to the Azure portal.
   - Click on "Create a resource" and select "Web App".
   - Fill in the required details (Subscription, Resource Group, Name, Runtime stack, etc.).
   - Click "Review + create" and then "Create".

2. Configure Deployment Credentials:
   - In the Azure portal, navigate to  Web App.
   - Go to "Deployment Center" and select "GitHub" as the source.
   - Authorize and select your repository and branch.
   - Click "Save".

3. Add Azure Credentials to GitHub Secrets:
   - In the Azure portal, go to  Web App and select "Deployment Center".
   - Click on "Manage deployment credentials" and note down the credentials.
   - Go to  GitHub repository.
   - Navigate to "Settings" > "Secrets and variables" > "Actions".
   - Add the following secrets:
     - `AZURE_WEBAPP_NAME`:  Web App name.
     - `AZURE_WEBAPP_PUBLISH_PROFILE`:  Web App publish profile content.

4. Create GitHub Actions Workflow:
   - In  GitHub repository, create a new file at `.github/workflows/azure-webapp.yml` with the following content:

     ```yaml
     name: Build and Deploy to Azure Web App

     on:
       push:
         branches:
           - main

     jobs:
       build-and-deploy:
         runs-on: ubuntu-latest

         steps:
           - name: Checkout code
             uses: actions/checkout@v2

           - name: Set up Python
             uses: actions/setup-python@v2
             with:
               python-version: '3.9'

           - name: Install dependencies
             run: |
               python -m pip install --upgrade pip
               pip install -r requirements.txt

           - name: Run tests
             run: |
               pytest

           - name: Deploy to Azure Web App
             uses: azure/webapps-deploy@v2
             with:
               app-name: ${{ secrets.AZURE_WEBAPP_NAME }}
               publish-profile: ${{ secrets.AZURE_WEBAPP_PUBLISH_PROFILE }}
               package: .
     ```

5. Commit and Push
   - Commit and push the changes to the GitHub repository.
   - This will trigger the GitHub Actions workflow to build and deploy your application to Azure.

6. Verify Deployment:
   - Go to the Azure portal and navigate to Web App.
   - Verify that  application is running successfully.
